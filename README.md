Hey! I'm @vonewman (Abdoulaye Diallo)

_Software engineer (and sometimes still a scientist) based in Dakar, Senegal_ <br>


I have been building APIs and tools for Machine Learning and data systems for startups in Dakar.


I like to build things with Deep Learning/Machine Learning, distributed systems, SQL and NoSQL databases, Docker, Python, Julia, JavaScript, modern backend APIs, and modern frontend frameworks.

I am passionate about science, technologie, specially Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing.

I'm currently dedicating a high percentage of my time to compete in Kaggle, contribute to open source projects and developing my start up sen.ai and my other open source projects. At the same time, I'm also helping a limited number of teams and organizations as an external consultant. If you would like to have my help with your team and product, feel free to contact me.
